THis is the Module 4 Pandas Homework assignment. The notebook analyzes a dataset of school and student information to determine how 
different facors such as budget, size, or type affect academics. The data includes information on 15 schools with a total of 39,170
students. The notebook starts by reading in 2 datasets and merging them together into a single dataframe. We first analyze the district 
as a whole based on the total number of schools, students, and budgets. The code finds the average reading and math scores and then finds the
percentage of students who are passing one or both subjects. The district_summary dataframe puts this into a digestable format. Next, the analysis 
dives deeper into school specific metrics. It calculates the budget per student at each school as well as the percentage of students passing 
reading or math or both. The school_summary dataframe shows all of this information. Next, we try to see if there are any correlations
between the amount of money that a school spends per student and the percentage of students who are passing. The code does this by creating 
bins for spending ranges and sorting the schools into them. The final two dataframes show how the schools grades compare to the size or type
of the school. I included a couple of my own takeaways from the analysis, but this analysis provides tremendous insight into all the 
factors listed above.
