# 📊 School District Analysis with Pandas

This project was completed as part of a data analysis module focused on using Pandas for data wrangling and exploration. The notebook analyzes a dataset of school and student performance to explore how different factors such as budget, school size, and school type affect academic outcomes.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

- Data includes **15 schools** and **39,170 students**.
- Two CSV files are merged to create a single, comprehensive DataFrame.
- Data points include school name, budget, size, type, student scores in math and reading, and more.

---

## 📈 Key Analyses

1. **District-Level Summary**
   - Total number of schools and students
   - Total and per-student budgets
   - Average math and reading scores
   - Overall passing percentages

2. **School-Level Summary**
   - Individual school performance
   - Budget per student
   - Passing percentages in reading, math, and both

3. **Spending Analysis**
   - Schools categorized into spending bins
   - Comparison of spending vs. student performance

4. **Size and Type Analysis**
   - Analysis of school performance based on size categories and school type

## 💡 Takeaways

- The **top 5 schools** with the highest overall passing rates are all **charter schools**, while the bottom 5 are **district schools**.
- Charter schools report **about 90% of students passing**, compared to **only 54% in district schools**, highlighting a significant disparity in outcomes.
- Surprisingly, the **amount of money spent per student** does **not correlate strongly** with student success, suggesting that **other factors such as possibly structural or systemic are at play**.
- These findings underscore the importance of **equity-focused data analysis** to better understand **opportunity gaps** in public education.
- This project reinforced how data can be used not only to summarize outcomes, but to **raise important questions** about how resources, policies, and school models impact student success across different communities.
- Developed and communicated insights using Pandas DataFrames, applying core data analysis concepts like grouping, binning, and merging datasets.
